# github-api-search
Between January and March 2020, I attended <a href="http://www.spiced-academy.com/" target="_blank">SPICED Academy</a>, an intensive 12-week coding program focused on Full Stack JavaScript Web Development in Berlin, Germany. During this program, I built a portfolio of web applications.

Project was built using GitHub API.  An AJAX call to API with username, password and userhandle pulls all the repositories and  commit comments for view. 

## Tech Stack
 * Javascript
 * JQuery
 * AJAX
 * HTML5
 * Handlebars
